                    <p>As a Full Stack Web Developer with a background in English education, analysis, and project management (PMP & SCRUM certified), I bring a unique blend of twenty-five years of experience to technology projects. Although my passion is software development, I draw on my years as a teacher, analyst, and project manager as I work on the code to ask insightful questions, organize my resources, test my work, and communicate clearly (whether it be writing documentation, giving large-group presentations to stakeholders, or moderating small-group interactions).</p>
                    <p>I also enjoy working with other cultures, having lived or traveled extensively in Africa, India, and the UK. Although I taught secondary school in Ethiopia and managed a content development team in England as a resident, I have also set up numerous off-shore teams in India and have traveled there many times. Each experience has added to my ability to collaborate with others.</p>
